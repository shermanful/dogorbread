Here's a thing that you (yes, YOU!) can use to check whether an image shows a dog or a loaf of bread You didn't even know you needed this! You did!



Just upload an image on the website and emojilate away!

You can hide the background (or not!)
You can also change the resolution of the emoji pixels
You can copy the emojillated image (it's actually just text!) or upload it to a gist. A GIST.
