<h2>Dog or Loaf of Bread</h2>

There are so many dogs out there that look like loaves of bread. If humans are thrown by these dogs, how must our machines interpret these furry friends? 

Using a custom machine learning model, this application compares any image you upload and determines whether it is a dog or a loaf of bread. 

Thatâ€™s it! Those are the only two options. Enjoy!
